Taverna Workbench is a redesign of the Taverna Workbench 1.7.x series from the ground up. 
It has a greater emphasis on scalability to enable the manipulation of larger and more diverse data.

In addition to the improvements to the engine, Taverna Workbench provides more support for workflow design 
   with a graphical workflow editor for direct manipulation of the workflow diagram, 
   context-specific views over Web services and other resources, 
   and standard editing facilities such as copy/paste and undo/redo.

For a list of our plans on adding new features to Taverna, please see the [Taverna Roadmap][1].
