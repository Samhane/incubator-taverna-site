Apache Taverna's source code is hosted at [git.apache.org](http://git.apache.org/), with read-only mirroring to 
[Github](https://github.com/apache/).

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><p><strong>Warning:</strong> As of 2014-12-02, the Taverna source code 
has not yet been migrated to the Apache Incubator infrastructure.</p>
<p>The current source code is still maintained at the 
<a href="https://github.com/taverna/" class="alert-link">taverna GitHub repositories</a>. 
</p></p>
The links below are to the temporary 
<a href="https://github.com/taverna-incubator" class="alert-link">taverna-incubator GitHub repositories</a> 
which are being prepared for staging to Apache. The structure of these might change significantly 
before the code has been fully migrated.
