</div>

Taverna Workbench 2.5 is available in several editions.

The [Core edition](/download/workbench/2-5/core/) contains a Taverna Workbench suitable for 
   building [scientific workflows](/introduction/why-use-workflows/) in any domain, 
   accessing general services such as REST or SOAP Web services and command line tools.

Domain-specific editions (see below) add support for specific service types and come 
   pre-populated with lists of available services and example workflows that are specifically 
   tailored for a given domain.

[Enterprise Taverna](/download/workbench/2-5/enterprise/) is equivalent to the 
   Core edition with  BioMart,BioMoby, SoapLab, API Consumer, Service Catalogue and 
   WebDAV installed.
