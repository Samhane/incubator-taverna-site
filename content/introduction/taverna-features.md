[The Taverna suite of tools]{/introduction/} are bringing together a range of features to make it easier for users to find, design and execute complex workflows and share them with other people.

Freely available

  - Java, open source, LPGL licensed (GPL for Astronomy versions)

Suite of tools to design, edit and execute workflows

  - Workflow design and execution in Taverna Workbench
  - Command line execution of workflows
  - Remote execution of workflows on a Taverna server
  - Invoke workflows from the Internet

Wide range of services and extensible architecture

  - Service discovery
  - Various service types available: WSDL-style and RESTful Web services, BioMart, BioMoby, SoapLab, R, 
         Beanshell, Excel and csv spreadsheets
  - Service creation for external tools or Java libraries
  - Calling tools/scripts on a local machine or remote machines (via ssh)
  - Extensible service plug-in architecture for adding new service types
  - [Fully integrated support for browsing curated service catalogues]{introduction/taverna-features/biocatalogue-integration/}, 
         such as the [BioCatalogue]{http://www.biocatalogue.org/}, for Web services (WSDL/SOAP and REST)
  - Interaction with a running workflow within a web browser
  - Ability to define and share semantically annotated components, and have them used as services in workflows

Secure

  - Support for secure services (HTTP authentication, WS-Security, X.509 client authentication)
  - Secure management of users’ credentials

Versatile Workbench

  - Tabs for finding, designing and executing workflows
  - Fully graphical workflow design
  - Drag and drop workflow components
  - Comprehensive undo/redo
  - Built-in help facility
  - Annotations for describing workflows, services, inputs, outputs
  - Workflow validation and debugging

Create your own or start from existing workflows

  - Easy design of new workflows
  - Load existing workflows (from a disk, [myExperiment]{http://www.myexperiment.org/} or a URL)
  - View workflow layout and logic
  - Modify existing workflows
  - Load workflows in off-line mode (when disconnected from the Internet)
  - Nested workflows (sub workflows)
  - Workflow validation during design time for debugging while composing a workflow
  - Built-in detection when a service’s interface changes or a service go off-line during design time

Find workflows created by others and share yours

  - [Full myExperiment search options for browsing workflows]{http://www.taverna.org.uk/introduction/taverna-features/myexperiment-integration/}
  - Publish workflows on myExperiment for use by others

Execute and debug your workflows

  - Execute workflows
  - Remember previously used workflow inputs
  - Save workflow input values used to a file
  - Load workflow input values from a file
  - Pipelining and streaming of data
  - Implicit iteration of service calls
  - Conditional and repeated calling of services
  - Customizable looping over a service
  - Failover and retry of service calling
  - Parallel execution and configurable number of concurrent threads
  - Improved error handling and reporting for debugging during run time
  - Monitor workflow execution
  - Pause/resume or cancel workflow execution
  - Manage previous runs and workflow results
  - View intermediate results and debug workflows at run time
  - Filter and save intermediate and final workflow results

Track workflow runs and results

  - Record workflow execution provenance
  - Review provenance of previous workflow runs
  - Experimental export of provenance in the [OPM]{http://openprovenance.org/} and Janus formats

Support

  - End user technical support and e-mail help desk
  - Tutorials and workshops
