Open Questions
--------------

**Taverna 2 Stuff**
Most of the current documentation is Taverna 2 based. 
Proposal migrate anyway and add a warning that this is mainly about None Apache Taverna 2

**Taverna 2 Downloads**
Should Taverna 2 downloads be included
Proposal yes keep <http://taverna.incubator.apache.org/download/pre-apache.html>

**Taverna in Use**
This section is across many pages and may need correction.
Proposal combine into a single page and correct once moved

**News**
Old website is wordpress based so has one page per news item.
Those few Apache sites that have a news page combine these into a single page.
Proposal make a single page for Archived non Apache news.
For Apache news decide between 

 1. Single news page manually filled in such as http://lucene.apache.org/mainnews
 2. Link to blog site such as https://blogs.apache.org/OOo/
 3. Work out way to capture so other stream

**Wiki**
<http://www.taverna.org.uk/> contains many links to <http://dev.mygrid.org.uk/wiki> 
The proposal is not to include wiki migration at this stage so to just include these links unless broken.

**Bootstrap / Style Questions**

class container (Fixed width) vs container-full (Full Width = Suggestion try Full

top bar: A single menu/nav bar one for every page.

side bar: For large pages longer than two screens even on a very wide screen.
Have a page specific menubar on the right. Possibly hiding it on small screens.
