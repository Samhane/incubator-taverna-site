To improve the Apache Taverna website, feel free to 
<a href="javascript:void(location.href='https://cms.apache.org/redirect?uri='+escape(location.href))">
edit of this page</a> using <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/cmsref.html">Apache CMS</a>. 
You will need an <code>@apache.org</code> account to commit your changes.

Update
------
If for some reason the edit page does not match the staged or production page, 
this could be because your version of cms is not up to date with the underlying svn repository.
Clicking on the [update] or [Update this directory] link, and then update this resource should solve that issue.

Bookmark
--------
The <a href="javascript:void(location.href='https://cms.apache.org/redirect?uri='+escape(location.href))">
edit of this page</a> works as it is from any Apache webpage. 
The bookmrk is actually a tiny bit of javascript which will redirect you to the correct edit page based on the webpage currently open.

The easiest is to drag the bookmark as is to your bookmark toolbar. You can also added it to your bookmark manually. 
Add the link location (javascript) as a bookmark and not the page that redirects too.

Anonymous
---------
It is possible to log on with the <code>anonymous</code> account but then you will not be able to commit any pages 
only submit suggested changes t the mailing list.

SVN
---
The raw pages are stored at <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/taverna/site/">SVN site</a>.
