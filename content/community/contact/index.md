You can contact and participate in the Apache Taverna community through the <strong>mailing lists</strong>.

The mailing lists are public. We suggest that all Taverna users join the <em>users@taverna</em> list 
â€“ this allows us to notify you of any critical issues or upcoming changes and allows you to have 
a say in the future development of Taverna. Anyone using the Taverna APIs in their own code 
would be well advised to join both <em>dev@taverna</em> and <em>users@taverna</em>.

### users@taverna


<em>users@taverna.incubator.apache.org</em> is intended for everyone who are using Taverna for
designing and running workflows. For instance, you may ask about your <strong>workflow design</strong>,
questions about how to do something in the Workbench, or <strong>raise issues</strong> you experience when using Taverna.
