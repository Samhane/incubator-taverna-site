Anyone in the [Apache Taverna community](/community/) 
can propose a release, although usually a release is
prepared by one of the [committers](/about/).
This page describes the procedure for preparing and voting 
over a release.

> Release early, release often

**Note**: This page is still a *draft* under development. See [TAVERNA-812](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TAVERNA-812)
