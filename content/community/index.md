Apache Taverna is a [incubator project](http://incubator.apache.org/) within the 
[The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)](http://www.apache.org/).

Taverna is an open source community that's organized by its 
   [members](http://people.apache.org/committers-by-project.html#taverna), including you! 
Whether you're running or [writing workflows](contribute-workflow), [developing plugins](contribute-plugin), 
   [hosting a taverna server](contribute-server), [hosting a service](#contribute-host),
  [hacking the core](#contribute-code), or just want to [editing](#contribute-edit) these pages 
there are opportunities for you to [get in touch and ask questions](#contact), 
   [contribute back](#contribute) or [report a bug](#reportbugs).

### Contribute a workflow

The best place to contribute Taverna workflows is on 
   [http://www.myexperiment.org](My Experiment). 

<a name="contribute-plugin"></a>
### Contribute a plugin ###
The process for writing Taverna 3 plugins is still underdevelopment.
Documentation for None Apache Taverna 2 plugins can be found at: 
[http://dev.mygrid.org.uk/wiki/display/developer/Creating+plugins+for+Taverna+2](http://dev.mygrid.org.uk/wiki/display/developer/Creating+plugins+for+Taverna+2)

In the future we plan on allowing plugin developers the choice of hosting their own plugins or committing then to Apache.

### Hosting a Taverna Server  
For information on hosting a Taverna Server to run Taverna workflows see the [Server](/documentation/server) Section.

<a name="contribute-host"></a>
### Hosting a Service for Taverna
For information on writing web services to be used in Taverna see our 
   [Web Service Developers](developers/web-service-developers) Section.

We recommend that your services are registered in Registries such as:
   [BioCatalogue](http://www.biocatalogue.org/BioCatalogue)

<a name="contribute-code"></a>
### Contributing Code

We are still in the process of moving Taverna code to Apache.
Once we have migrated you will be able to submit patches in the standard Apache way.
In the mean time you can find the latest NONE Apache sourcecode at:
[https://github.com/taverna](https://github.com/taverna)

<a name="contribute-edit"></a>

The website is currently under development.
Please help make it better by [editting](community/edit) or adding pages.

## Contact

You can contact and participate in the Apache Taverna community through the <strong>mailing lists</strong>.

The mailing lists are public. We suggest that all Taverna users join the <em>users@taverna</em> list 
â€“ this allows us to notify you of any critical issues or upcoming changes and allows you to have 
a say in the future development of Taverna. Anyone using the Taverna APIs in their own code 
would be well advised to join both <em>dev@taverna</em> and <em>users@taverna</em>.

### users@taverna

<em>users@taverna.incubator.apache.org</em> is intended for everyone who are using Taverna for
designing and running workflows. For instance, you may ask about your <strong>workflow design</strong>,
questions about how to do something in the Workbench, or <strong>raise issues</strong> you experience when using Taverna.
